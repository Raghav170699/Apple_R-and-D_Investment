# Impact of R&D Investment on Apple's Economic Performance

The objective of the data analysis for this project is to measure the impact of investments made by Apple Inc. on its Research and Development, on the economic value of the company. For said analysis I have considered ‘R&D Expenses’ as the company’s total expenditure on R&D and ‘Total Assets’ which represents the economic performance of the company from 2016-2018. 

## Basic Methodology

The first step involves the collection of the relevant data from the data set provided, and to clean this raw data sample to produce the final data that shall be used for the analysis. Then, a descriptive analysis is conducted in order to compare how Apple Inc. fares in the current market in comparison to the set of competitors. A regression analysis is then conducted in order to measure the impact of R&D investments on the company’s economic value. Subsequently, a forecasting analysis is carried out to ascertain whether Apple Inc. should be spending more on its Research and Development or if their current investment strategy would suffice.

## Key Findings

### R&D Investment Trends

Apple's R&D expenses increased steadily from $10,045M (2016) to $14,236M (2018)
Average R&D investment during the period: $11,954M
Employee count grew from 116,000 (2016) to 132,000 (2018)
Total assets showed consistent growth from $321,686M (2016) to $375,319M (2018)

### Competitive Analysis

Apple maintained higher average R&D expenditure compared to competitors
Competitor spending showed high variance, with some companies like HP Inc. investing significantly less
Apple positioned in the mid to upper end of the market spectrum based on total assets

### Regression Analysis Results

Positive correlation between R&D investments and total assets
For every 1-unit increase in R&D spending, total assets increased by 27.66 units
Model controlled for number of employees

### Predictive Analysis

Projected R&D expenses for 2019: $15,633M (based on historical growth)
Predicted employee count for 2019: 137,333
Forecasted total assets: $421,106M
Results supported continuation of increased R&D investment strategy

## Business Impact and Strategy

### R&D investments contributed to:

1. Development of proprietary processors for iPhones
2. In-house Bluetooth chip design for AirPods
3. Initiation of Project Titan (self-driving cars)
4. Advancement in AR technology
5. Enhanced sustainability initiatives


## Study Limitations

1. Does not account for other investment factors (e.g., marketing)
2. Assumes linear relationship between R&D and total assets
3. Limited timeframe (3 years)

## Conclusion

The analysis demonstrates a strong positive relationship between R&D investments and Apple's economic performance. The results support Apple's strategy of maintaining substantial R&D investments, showing that such investments contribute significantly to the company's growth and market position.
