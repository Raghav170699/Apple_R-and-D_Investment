# Impact of R&D Investment on Apple's Economic Performance

The objective of the data analysis for this project is to measure the impact of investments made by Apple Inc. on its Research and Development, on the economic value of the company. For said analysis I have considered ‘R&D Expenses’ as the company’s total expenditure on R&D and ‘Total Assets’ which represents the economic performance of the company from 2016-2018. 

## Basic Methodology

The first step involves the collection of the relevant data from the data set provided, and to clean this raw data sample to produce the final data that shall be used for the analysis. Then, a descriptive analysis is conducted in order to compare how Apple Inc. fares in the current market in comparison to the set of competitors. A regression analysis is then conducted in order to measure the impact of R&D investments on the company’s economic value. Subsequently, a forecasting analysis is carried out to ascertain whether Apple Inc. should be spending more on its Research and Development or if their current investment strategy would suffice.
